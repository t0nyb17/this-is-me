## 🔭 What I Do

- I turn ideas into interactive experiences.
- I chase problems with curiosity, not fear.
- I believe every bug hides a lesson worth learning.
- I craft code that connects, not just compiles.

## ✨ Philosophy

> Code should be readable like poetry, structured like architecture, and expressive like art.

I approach development not just as a career—but as a canvas. Whether it's a CLI tool or a distributed system, each project is a chance to ask _"What if?"_

## 🌱 Learning in Public

Every commit is a breadcrumb. Every issue I solve is a map for someone else. I value transparency, collaboration, and sharing the 'how' behind the code—not just the 'what'.
